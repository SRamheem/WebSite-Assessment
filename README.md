# WebSite-Assessment

This HTML markup represents a web page layout for a hypothetical application named "InnovationHub." It includes a header section with the company logo and name, a main content area where product information would be displayed, a footer section with buttons for actions like archiving and deleting items, and a left bottom corner section containing links for inviting teammates, accessing help, and managing billing. The page layout is designed to be responsive, adjusting its display based on the screen size. JavaScript functions are referenced for handling client-side actions.
